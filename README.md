🧭 AI Travel Designer Agent
This project is a smart, AI-powered travel planning system using OpenAI Agent SDK. It coordinates between specialized agents to plan a complete travel experience for users—based on their mood, interests, and preferences.

✨ What It Does
The system interacts through the command-line and simulates a complete trip plan:

Recommends destinations based on mood or interests
Suggests flights and hotels using mock data tools
Recommends places to visit and food options
🧠 Agents Involved
The core agent (TravelMasterAgent) delegates tasks to the following:

Agent Name	Responsibility
DestinationAgent	Finds suitable travel destinations
BookingAgent	Simulates flight/hotel booking
ExploreAgent	Suggests attractions and local food
All agents are coordinated using handoffs.
