ðŸ§­ AI Travel Designer Agent
This project is a smart, AI-powered travel planning system using OpenAI Agent SDK. It coordinates between specialized agents to plan a complete travel experience for usersâ€”based on their mood, interests, and preferences.

âœ¨ What It Does
The system interacts through the command-line and simulates a complete trip plan:

Recommends destinations based on mood or interests
Suggests flights and hotels using mock data tools
Recommends places to visit and food options
ðŸ§  Agents Involved
The core agent (TravelMasterAgent) delegates tasks to the following:

Agent Name	Responsibility
DestinationAgent	Finds suitable travel destinations
BookingAgent	Simulates flight/hotel booking
ExploreAgent	Suggests attractions and local food
All agents are coordinated using handoffs.
